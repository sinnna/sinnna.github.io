Bilevel optimization involves a hierarchical
structure where one problem is nested within another,
leading to complex interdependencies between levels. We
propose a single-loop, tuning-free algorithm that guarantees
anytime feasibility, i.e., approximate satisfaction of the
lower-level optimality condition, while ensuring descent
of the upper-level objective. At each iteration, a convex
quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP) with
a closed-form solution yields the search direction, followed
by a backtracking line search inspired by control barrier
functions to ensure safe, uniformly positive step sizes. The
resulting method is scalable, requires no hyperparameter
tuning, and converges under mild local regularity assumptions. We establish an O(1/k) ergodic convergence rate in
terms of a first-order stationary metric and demonstrate the
algorithm’s effectiveness on representative bilevel tasks.
