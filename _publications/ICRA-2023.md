We propose a novel Branch-and-Bound method
for reachability analysis of neural networks in both open-loop
and closed-loop settings. Our idea is to first compute accurate
bounds on the Lipschitz constant of the neural network in
certain directions of interest offline using a convex program.
We then use these bounds to obtain an instantaneous but
conservative polyhedral approximation of the reachable set
using Lipschitz continuity arguments. To reduce conservatism,
we incorporate our bounding algorithm within a branching
strategy to decrease the over-approximation error within an
arbitrary accuracy. We then extend our method to reachability
analysis of control systems with neural network controllers.
Finally, to capture the shape of the reachable sets as accurately
as possible, we use sample trajectories to inform the directions
of the reachable set over-approximations using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We evaluate the performance of the
proposed method in several open-loop and closed-loop settings
