I am a PhD candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Johns Hopkins University. I work with [Dr. Mahyar Fazlyab](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/mahyar-fazlyab/) at the intersection of Machine Learning (ML), Optimization, and Control Theory.
My research experience includes adversarial robustness, reachability analysis, out-of-distribution detection, and bilevel optimization, with resulting publications in ICML, ECCV, ACC, and ICRA.

My current focus is on applying rigorous optimization and control-theoretic methods to develop robust and efficient generative AI systems. I am particularly interested in flow matching, diffusion-based generative models, and the optimization challenges that arise in training and scaling large language models (LLMs).
