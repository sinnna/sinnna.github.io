I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Johns Hopkins University. I work with [Dr. Mahyar Fazlyab](https://www.ece.jhu.edu/mahyarfazlyab/) at the intersection of Machine Learning (ML), Optimization, and Control Theory.
A central theme of my work is ***trustworthy AI***, developing methods to address the fundamental reliability challenges of modern neural networks, which currently limit their deployment in safety-critical applications. Complementing this application-driven work, I also advance the theoretical foundations of optimization, providing the mathematical tools and insights that support the development of reliable learning systems.

Building on these themes, my research has explored several key challenges in machine learning and computer vision. This includes ***adversarial robustness***, which studies how models can resist carefully crafted input perturbations; ***reachability analysis***, which provides formal guarantees on the behaviors of neural networks; and ***out-of-distribution*** (OOD) detection, which focuses on identifying inputs that differ significantly from the training data. Alongside these application-driven directions, I have also worked on ***bilevel optimization***, a theoretical framework for hierarchical optimization problems with wide-ranging applications in machine learning and control. These efforts have resulted in publications at top-tier venues, including ICML, ECCV, ACC, and ICRA.

On top of continuing my work on bilevel optimization, I am exploring the application of rigorous optimization methods to modern machine learning and computer vision systems, with a focus on improving their efficiency and scalability. I am particularly interested in researching generative models, such as ***flow matching*** and diffusion, as well as the optimization challenges that arise in training ***large language models (LLMs)*** and ensuring their reliability, including issues like hallucination detection.
